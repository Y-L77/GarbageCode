cap the shit out of the home page

add gemini gif in the credits

tell zain farooq to shbau

say goodnight to mohammad misbah uddin

make it such that there is a disclaimer on the home page warning people to not execute some of the pseudocode snippets because they can cause memory leaks and crash the program

tie it back with real recycling but instead of saving the world of pollution we save the compiler from terrible code
