            <p>Failure is a crucial catalyst for growth, and the optimal rate of failure is around 15%.<br>At this precise level, you push your boundaries just enough to learn and improve, while<br>ensuring that failure remains a tool for progress, not a source of discouragement or burnout</p>

            <h3>Clean code info</h3>
            <p>Clean code is generally classified as code that solves a specific problem. It's easy to read and maintain and often uses functions or passes arguments to functions to achieve efficent and readable solutions.<br><br>Clean code should also be modular and should be easy to test, not a lot of hard-coded values and follows best practice.</p>

            <h3>Recyclable code</h3>
            <p><br>Recyclable code is often very efficent at what it does and is very modular to tackle on common problems. <br><br>Examples of recyclable code are standard functions, such as sorting, or finding a prime number.</p>

            <h3>Garbage code</h3>
            <p><br>Code that does not follow best practice, probably very inefficent, cursed or doesn't even compile properly. Examples of garbage code is code which unecessary complexity, written in unpractical languages and code that have 5000+ if conditions.</p>
