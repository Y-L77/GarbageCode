            <h2>Why We Made This Web App</h2>
            <p>
                This web app was created with students in mind—to help them improve their analytical skills when reviewing code. Coding isn’t just about writing lines of text;
                it’s about understanding structure, efficiency, and readability. By playing this game, students can sharpen their logic, develop a critical eye for well-written
                code, and recognize patterns in coding best practices.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The game draws inspiration from environmental welfare concepts, particularly waste management and recycling. Just as we categorize trash into recyclables, compost,
                and waste, coding follows a similar principle. Clean code is like properly disposed waste—it’s efficient, reusable, and easy to maintain. Recyclable code, like reusable
                materials, can be repurposed in different projects, saving time and effort. Trash code, on the other hand, clogs up projects and makes debugging a nightmare, just as
                unmanaged waste harms the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                This demo app was inspired by the potential of Gemini's AI integration to enhance coding education. Initially, we aimed to integrate Gemini to generate dynamic coding prompts, showcasing AI's ability to adapt to user skill levels. For this demo version, instead of integrating gemini to the project we leveraged machine learning techniques to generate fine-tuned coding questions that created structured learning with relevant patterns to clean code. (I gave gemini example snippets and told it to generate more)
